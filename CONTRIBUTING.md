# Contributing to FlowWarden Redis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FlowWarden Redis! Every contribution matters — whether it's a bug report, a feature suggestion, a documentation fix, or a code change.

Please note that this project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Ways to Contribute

> **Please open an issue before submitting a PR**, both for bug fixes and new features. This avoids wasted work on changes that may not align with the project direction, and keeps reviews focused.

- **Report bugs** — Open an issue with clear reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and your environment (Java version, Spring Boot version, Redis version). For non-trivial bugs, please provide a **runnable test case** (pushed to your fork) that isolates the issue. This dramatically speeds up triage and resolution.
- **Suggest features** — Open an issue describing the use case and why it would benefit the project.
- **Submit pull requests** — Code, tests, documentation improvements are all welcome.
- **Improve documentation** — Typos, unclear explanations, missing examples — every bit helps.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (tested on 17 and 21)
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker (required by Testcontainers)

### Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowwarden-io/flowwarden-redis.git
cd flowwarden-redis
./mvnw clean verify
```

> **Note:** You do not need a local Redis installation. Testcontainers automatically provisions a Redis server during integration tests.

> **Note:** When `main` temporarily depends on a `-SNAPSHOT` of `flowwarden-stream-core` (between core releases), resolve it either by configuring a GitHub PAT with `read:packages` for server id `github` in your `~/.m2/settings.xml`, or by building the core locally: `git clone https://github.com/flowwarden-io/flowwarden-stream-core && cd flowwarden-stream-core && ./mvnw install -DskipTests`.

## Architecture Constraints

Before writing code, please be aware of the following design points:

- **Minimal dependencies.** The library depends on `flowwarden-stream-core` (for the SPIs), `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` (Lettuce client), and Spring Boot autoconfigure. Any new compile-scope dependency must be justified and approved via an issue before implementation.
- **SPI contract.** The `LockService` and `CheckpointStore` interfaces ship with abstract contract tests (`LockServiceContractTest`, `CheckpointStoreContractTest`) in `flowwarden-stream-core-testkit`. Every backend implementation in this repo extends those contract tests in integration tests — any change that affects observable SPI behavior must keep them green.
- **Atomicity matters.** The lock acquire/renew/release flow uses Lua scripts to keep compare-and-set atomic. The checkpoint `saveSeen` / `saveProcessed` use targeted `HSET` so the dual-token semantics from the core are preserved natively. Don't replace these with read-modify-write patterns unless you have a very good reason.
- **Imperative and reactive parity.** Each SPI has both a blocking implementation (`RedisLockService`, `RedisCheckpointStore`) and a reactive-backed wrapper (`ReactiveRedisLockService`, `ReactiveRedisCheckpointStore`). Behavior must be identical — both validate against the same contract tests.

## Coding Standards

- **Java 17 target.** Use records, pattern matching, `var`, sealed classes where they improve readability.
- **No Lombok.**
- **Apache 2.0 license headers** on every `.java` file (enforced by `license-maven-plugin` — run `./mvnw license:format` to apply).
- **Tests required.** New behavior needs new tests. Bug fixes need a regression test.
- **No new third-party dependencies** without prior discussion in an issue.

## Commit & PR Workflow

- Branch from `main` with a descriptive name: `feat/short-description`, `fix/issue-id-slug`, `chore/slug`.
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`.
- **DCO sign-off required** — `git commit -s` (or `git config --global format.signOff true`).
- **Signed commits required** — SSH ed25519 signature, enforced by branch protection.
- One concern per PR. Smaller PRs ship faster.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for any user-visible change.
- Wait for CI green before requesting review.
